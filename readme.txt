Love WordPress SEO by Yoast, but hate its dashboard clutter? Well, look no further!

== Description ==

[WordPress SEO by Yoast](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) is a fantastic plugin for optimising your site's search engine performance. The only problem is that it makes a mess of your WordPress dashboard by adding columns, meta boxes and custom fields that can be very confusing for you and your clients. These additional items are great for SEO power-users, but for the average joe they just get in the way and make your dashboard difficult to use, especially if you have a smaller screen.

"WordPress SEO Tamer" fixes this problem by giving you options to remove all of the admin columns, meta boxes and custom fields that are generated by WordPress SEO itself. If you don't configure any of the options and just activate the plugin, then you'll enjoy an instantly cleaner WordPress dashboard without losing any of the other useful functionality provided by WordPress SEO. Alternatively, you can configure the plugin to only hide the WordPress SEO elements on selected post types and taxonomies.

This plugin is great for:

* Removing fields, boxes & columns that would otherwise confuse you and your clients
* De-cluttering your WordPress dashboard, but not losing the power of WordPress SEO's great background features

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do you have against Yoast? =

Nothing at all - I just don't like the huge amount of dashboard clutter that his WordPress SEO plugin generates. A clean dashboard is a happy dashboard.

= Doesn't this plugin just remove all of WordPress SEO's important functions? =

It depends how you use WordPress SEO. If you like all of the background functions (meta data, titles, sitemap, etc.), but don't use the post-specific functions then you need this plugin. However, if you like to customise your SEO info for each post, then this plugin is not for you.
