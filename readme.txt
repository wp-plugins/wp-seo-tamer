Love WordPress SEO by Yoast, but hate its dashboard clutter? Well, look no further!

== Description ==

[WordPress SEO by Yoast](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) is a fantastic plugin for optimising your site's search engine performance. The only problem is that it makes a mess of your WordPress dashboard by adding columns, meta boxes, custom fields and even ads. These additional items are great for SEO power-users, but for the average joe they just get in the way and make your dashboard difficult to use.

"WordPress SEO Tamer" fixes this problem by removing all of the admin columns, meta boxes, custom fields and ads that are generated by WordPress SEO itself. There are no options to configure - just activate the plugin and enjoy a cleaner WordPress dashboard without losing any of the other useful functionality provided by WordPress SEO. The changes apply to all post types, taxonomies and WordPress SEO settings pages.

This plugin is great for:

* Removing fields, columns & ads that would otherwise confuse your clients
* De-cluttering your WordPress dashboard, but not losing the power of WordPress SEO's great background features

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do you have against Yoast? =

Nothing at all - I just don't like the huge amount of dashboard clutter that his WordPress SEO plugin generates.

= Doesn't this plugin just remove all of WordPress SEO's important functions? =

It depends how you use WordPress SEO. If you like all of the background functions (meta data, titles, sitemap, etc.), but don't use the post-specific functions then you need this plugin. However, if you like to customise your SEO info for each post, then this plugin is not for you.

= How do I get the admin columns and meta box to display for a few specific post types? =

Simply use the `wordpress_seo_tamer_exclude_post_types` filter to return an array of post types for which you would like the columns and meta box to display.
